## About Me

As a student at the University of Washington, I continue to pursue my passion for the intersection of computer science
and business. I've spent the past few years exploring the ways in which technology and entrepreneurship intersect. My
hands-on experience starting several small online businesses has given me practical knowledge of various technologies,
modern programming languages (e.g. Python, Go, and JS), and e-commerce platforms.

I have a strong commitment to continuous learning and am always seeking to expand my knowledge and skills. I approach
challenges with a team-first mentality, believing that collaboration, transparency, experimentation, and the willingness
to embrace failure are keys to success. My ultimate aim is to use my passions and skills to create impactful digital
products that solve real-world problems.

I'm currently exploring AI and its applications in the field of cybersecurity! I'm also working on a few personal
projects, one of which is a mobile app that allows users to share, save, and create recipes with friends and family.
